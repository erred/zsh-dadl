# dadl
*Dual Arrows, Double line*

## Overview
Much like the [pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure) prompt I used (and what this was based on), it's simple and clean

## Features (or lack thereof)

shows:
  * path
  * user@host on ssh
  * screen
  * virtualenv

doesn't show
  * git

## Install
There's the [proper way (no npm for me)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure#install)

Or you could be like me and just `source dadl.zsh`
